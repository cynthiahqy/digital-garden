So, I just spent an hour preparing the tweet for my [latest blog post](https://www.cynthiahqy.com/posts/r-markdown-and-friends/)[^1]. Why? Because I wanted the tweet to show a preview of the blog post, but no matter how many times I copy and pasted the link, no preview appeared. Thus, I had no choice but to go down the rabbit hole of trying to Google how to do something without knowing what that thing is called...

## Twitter Cards?

I started by searching `blogdown image default`, because:

-   there's way more **Blogdown** content out in the wild than **Quarto** (for now..) and,
-   my mission started from a stubborn (and not at all time-efficient) refusal to separately upload the thumbnail image of my blog post to Twitter.

Unfortunately, this search yielded nothing useful... so I resorted to snooping the `.html` source code and Github repo of the wonderful [**A quarto tip a day**](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-tip-a-day) website:

I managed to eventually work out that the preview things I wanted to make appear were called **Twitter Cards**. So I turned them on... or so I thought. I edited my Quarto project metadata (`_quarto.yml`), pushed the changes to my GitHub repo, refreshed my Netlify hosted website multiple times, but still no **Twitter Card**...

## Social Metadata Options!

Long story short[^2], I needed to do BOTH of the following:

[^2]: In fact, this post has taken less time to write than figuring out how to set up Twitter Cards did...

1.  Include my website URL in `_quarto.yml`:

``` yaml
website:
  site-url: https://www.cynthiahqy.com
```

You can publish your website without including the `site-url:` option (I know because I did that), but `quarto render` won't produce `robots.txt` or `sitemap.xml` for you, and your image links won't be properly prepended:

2.  Turn on **Social Metadata** options in `_quarto.yml`

Quarto very helpfully includes tools for generating the metadata required by Twitter to generate preview cards. However, you need to turn those tools on:

``` yaml
website:
  site-url: https://www.cynthiahqy.com
  open-graph: true
  twitter-card:
    creator: "@cynthiahqy"
```

## Resources and References

A quick reference for the social metadata options can be found in the ***Reference/Projects/Websites*** section of the Quarto official docs, but the examples in [***Guide/Websites/Social Metadata***](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-tools.html#social-metadata) are much easier to understand.

The [***Getting started with Cards***](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/guides/getting-started) guide on the Twitter Developer Platform helped me understand the difference between the `site:` and `creator:` YAML options. Basically, use `site:` for "Website Attribution" of the publisher (e.g.`"@nytimes"`), and `creator` for the individual user who created the content inside the card (e.g. `"@cynthiahqy"`).

## Make your own Quarto Blog

If you are interested in using Quarto to make your own blog, a good place to start is Bea Milz's blog post [***Creating a blog with Quarto in 10 steps***](https://beamilz.com/posts/2022-06-05-creating-a-blog-with-quarto/en/).

## Epilogue

-   Debugging: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/guides/troubleshooting-cards#missing_text
-   Tried changing the image multiple times BUT the link was the same because I used `featured.png`, i.e. Twitter didn't re-fetch the image
