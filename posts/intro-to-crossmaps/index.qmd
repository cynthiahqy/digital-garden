I mentioned in my last blog post about plotting bipartite graphs using {ggraph} that I've been working on a new approach to recoding or redistributing categorical data that uses

## Assertive Programming

What did I mean by "validate the mapping objects, instead of the data before and after transformation?"

## Cheatsheet for the Crossmap Approach

## {xmap} package

The {xmap} packages offers tools to implement the crossmap approach, verify exisiting workflows and summarise mappings.
