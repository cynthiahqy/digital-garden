## The Task

Say you have a folder of images you want to include in a custom figure layout within a Quarto document. Here's what such folder might look like:

```terminal
layout-folder-images/
├── index.qmd
└── images/
    ├── image-001.png
    ├── image-002.png
```

Let's say we want to include the `image-00*.png` images side-by-side. The Quarto markdown for this might look like:

````{.md filename="index.qmd"}
::: {layout-ncol=2}
!()[images/image-001.png]

!()[images/image-002.png]

:::
````

## Code chunk magic

Writing out markdown is fine for a few images, but it could get quickly get tedious (e.g. a whole folder). Instead, why not use an R code chunk^[based on this [stackover flow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34185130/can-i-link-to-all-image-files-in-a-directory-in-rmd)] to generate the markdown:

```{{r}}
#| output: asis
img_files <- fs::dir_ls("images", glob="*.png")
cat("::: {layout-ncol=2}\n",
    glue::glue("![]({img_files})\n\n\n"),
    ":::",
    sep = ""
)
```

## Example Output

Here's some example output[^2] using some sketchnotes I drew many years ago:

```{r}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
img_files <- fs::dir_ls("images", glob="*.png")
cat("::: {layout-ncol=2}\n",
    glue::glue("![]({img_files})\n\n\n"),
    ":::",
    sep = ""
)
```

[^2]: **Note to future me:** the example images come from a pdf (also in the source folder). This is the zsh command I used to extract each page as separate images using imagemagick: `convert -quality 100 -density 200 ${filename}.pdf image-%02d.png`

## Code Explanation

And finally, an explanation of how the code works:

```r
img_files <- fs::dir_ls(images, glob="*.png") # <1>
cat("::: {layout-ncol=3}\n",                  # <2>
    glue::glue("![]({img_files})\n\n\n"),     # <3>
    ":::",                                    # <3>
    sep = ""                                  # <4>
)
```
1. Get paths to all the image files in the `images/` folder.
2. Use `cat()` to output the starting fence for the custom figure layout div.
3. Use `glue()` to generate the inline image links for each image separated by new lines (required for custom layouts). Output the links with `cat()` and close the figure div.
4. Set `cat()` to output each markdown component without any additional whitespace.

## Notes and Extension Ideas

- If your images have a natural order to them (as mine do in the example above), make sure your file names reflect this ordering. I think `dir_ls()` sorts alphabetically by default, so make sure to pad your numbering if you've got more than 9 files (i.e. to avoid `image-10.png` appearing before `image-9.png`).
- Quarto allows you to specify custom layouts with non-equal columns/rows. See [Figures in the official Quarto Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html) for more.
- My example doesn't support captions (i.e. the `[]` element is empty). You could easily rectify this by storing both file names and their captions in the same table, and using `glue::glue_data()` to generate a string from an expression like: `"![{caption}]({img_path})"`. See [this documentation](https://glue.tidyverse.org/reference/glue.html) from the `{glue}` package for more details.

I wrote this code in order to bulk embed written notes I wrote at a few conferences last year into Quarto websites. I'll be writing about how I use Quarto as a personal knowledge management tool/scrapbook/research compendium in an upcoming blog post. Stay tuned!
