## Multi-Format Sourcery

### The Brief?

<!--- multi-format CV using dynamic generation features of quarto --->
<!--- Rob kindly wrote me a latex template... but it didn't quite translate to html --->

### The Current Product

- insert images

## How I built it

### A Chance Encounter and some sample code

- Ran into @jimjam-slam at Mine's "What's new in the tidyverse?" talk
- kindly pointed me to this issue where he worked through html2pdf options
- https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/2538

### Hacking it together with some help of ChatGPT

- color selectors
- delete stuff and see if it still works
- ask chatgpt to explain with examples! (started out asking about something else, but it was useful nonetheless)
  - https://chat.openai.com/c/c5b58373-bf42-4c60-a2bd-ea4accd8c114

## Do it yourself!

### Dynamic content

Let's keep things simple with just two sections:

````md
## Education

```{r}
# import from orcid
```

## Work Experience

list it out!
````

### Now add the CSS magic

- at-rules (@media, @page): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@page
- adjusting dimensions: https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/stable/common_use_cases.html#adjust-document-dimensions
- print-only / no-print classes
- page breaks via style spans: https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-tip-a-day/posts/11-spans/
- page numbers: https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/838

still to fix:
- font-size
- spacing between elements
