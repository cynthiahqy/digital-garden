title: "teaching *with* R and Rmarkdown"
draft: true
---

There are heaps of tutorials, guides, blog posts about teaching R to students, and for learning, but what about using R to automate away the boring stuff of teaching? <!--# maybe this should be a series? -->

# Find and replace, (mail) merge and friends

This section is basically about ways to avoid manual copy/paste when you need to customise feedback, content or instructions. An obvious example is dropping student names into feedback templates.

## Concepts

-   **template** text with placeholders
-   **details** to put in the placeholders
-   (optional) **rules** for matching details with specific templates
-   **assembler** to stick it all together

|           | MS Office                                              | RMarkdown                             |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Template  | word document, excel file                              | light-weight markup, or straight text |
| Details   | student names, grades in some order                    | tidy table                            |
| Rules     | different comments for different grades                | if/else, case statements              |
| Assembler | Copy -\> Paste -\> Save, or maybe MS Office Mail Merge | mailmerge, rmarkdown params, glue     |

## RMarkdown toolkit

-   Why do we need?
    -   Rmarkdown (quarto also would work)
    -   R
    -   tidyverse
