    "text": "I use emojis everywhere. They make me happy. I use them to quickly capture sparks of feelings and idea, to decorate otherwise boring plain-text, to categorise things like to-do tasks and time-blocks, and in my journal to write “emoji stories” about things that happen in my life1. For example, this emoji story is about making seafood ravioli and lasagne from scratch with my partner: 🐟🦐🦪➕👨🏼‍🍳🧑🏻‍🍳🔜🍝🥟.\nThat is all to say, I’ve spent a non-trivial amount of time working out how to include emojis in things I type, and this post is the a collection of the things I’ve learnt. So, without further ado, here are some resources on how to incorporate emojis into almost everything, plus some bonus emoji opinions and trivia."

    "text": "Inserting Emojis ⌨️\nFirst up, there are a few ways to include emojis in text that you are typing:\n\nShortcodes\nShortcodes are codes that allow you to “type” emojis using a short version of the emoji name. For example, :smiley: for 😃.2\nShortcodes are supported in most extended markdown formats and markdown editors:\n\nAvailable with auto-complete prompts in applications like Slack, RStudio Visual Mode and Notion.\nSome platforms like Slack even support custom shortcode aliases and additional emojis.\nThe {emo} R package provides support for adding emojis as in-line code chunks to Rmarkdown via shortcode. E.g. 😄 renders to 😄.3\n\nPRO:\n\nQuick once you know the shortcodes.\n\nCON:\n\nYou need to know and remember the shortcodes, or at least the start of the shortcode for applications that support auto-complete.\nShortcodes vary from application to application. This means shortcodes in one flavour of markdown might not render the same way or at all in a different flavour of markdown.4\n\nSome cheatsheets for finding the application-specific shortcode for an emoji:\n\nHolopod’s Slack Emoji Cheatsheet\nWebFX’s Emoji Cheatsheet\nEmojibase’s Shortcodes table\n\n\n\nEmoji Pickers\nEmoji pickers are input tools that allow you to browse and select emojis. They can include inline pop-up keyboards and search helpers, or a separate Character/Symbol dialog windows.\nYour operating system will likely provide a default emoji picker tool (though they are all annoyingly given different names…):\n\non macOS: use the shortcut CTRL + ATL + SPACE to bring up the Character Viewer\non iOS/iPadOS: select the emoji keyboard using Emoji Button or Globe from any text input.\non Windows: use the shortcut WINDOWS-KEY + . to bring up the Emoji Panel.\n\nEmojipedia’s Can I Emoji? page links to guides for emoji usage on other common devices.\nSome applications also provide emoji pickers, which you can usually access via the SPECIAL CHARACTER item in the INSERT menu, and/or the associated keyboard shortcut.\n\nin Rstudio Visual Mode:\n\nuse the catch-all shortcut ⌘ /emoji to bring up the emoji picker.\nAlternatively, use the menu sequence Insert -> Special Characters -> Emoji… to bring up an emoji picker.\n\n\nPRO:\n\nUse search terms to find emojis. Great for when you don’t know the exact emoji you want to use, or are looking to find a suitable emoji. If you want more search results, try Emojipedia’s search5.\n\nCON:\n\nSlower than shortcodes when inserting frequently used emojis.\nThe picker will usually close after you insert one emoji, so you need to open the picker repeatedly if you are inserting multiple emojis.\n\n\n\nCopy-Paste\nWhen all else fails you can try to copy-paste the emoji from somewhere like Emojipedia. Basically any application that supports UTF-8 encoding should display emoji characters. I don’t really consider this a viable method though because it is too slow and cumbersome to use in day-to-day workflows.\n\n\nComparing Input Methods\nExactly which methods are available depends on what application or file format you are working with. Keep in mind that support for displaying or rendering emojis doesn’t automatically mean it will be easy to insert emojis.\nMy general strategy for figuring out how to add emojis into a particular workflow is to Google “emoji” + whichever program/markup/environment I’m working in. If you’re using a tool that supports markdown, try searching the Tools directory of The Markdown Guide.\nPersonally, I tend to use shortcodes for frequently used and more “generic” emojis, but switch to an emoji picker if I want to browse, or to insert a specific version of an emoji (e.g. picking a different skin-tone)."

This is something to keep in mind if you are including emojis in text intended for a broader audience, or in communication with someone you know might use a screen reader. Two important and relatively easy to implement tips I’ve come across are putting important information BEFORE any emojis, and limiting the number of emojis you use.7\n\nEmojis and Accessibility: The Dos and Don’ts of Including Emojis in Texts and Emails by Beth Finke\n\n\n\nMatters of Taste\nPeople come up with all sorts of creative ways to use emojis, and as with all things on the internet, other people have opinions. I don’t agree with prescribing rules for how people use emojis so I haven’t linked to anyone decrying the alleged demise of “proper” communication due to emoji usage 🙄. However, the following posts did give me some food for thought.\n\nI’m a Gen Z-er and I want you to stop using emojis by Karen Ying.8\nWhat happened when I stopped using Emojis by @Clo_S.
