    "text": "Workshop Recap\n\n\n\nOverview thumbnails of slides from each workshop section. Dark blue slides were covered in detail, whilst orange slides were only briefly touched on. Iframes were used throughout to display external resources.\n\n\n\nKey Concepts\nAfter introducing myself and giving a high-level overview of the workshop structure, I spent about 30 minutes explaining:\n\nBenefits of a reproducible publishing workflow, using the specific example of eliminating the dreaded ‚Äúcopy-paste‚Äù updating cycle.\nWhy R Markdown is a great starting point for building a reproducible publishing workflow. Rather than enumerate the many benefits, I directed them to the many ‚ÄúWhy use R-Markdown‚Äù articles that have already been written, and emphasised the abundance of resources available.\nR Markdown as an authoring framework, your friendly magical publishing wizards (c/o Allison Horst), and/or your multi-talented publishing robot (c/o yours truly).\nThe basic anatomy of an .Rmd file, and what‚Äôs happening under the hood.\na brief what and why of Quarto. I used the visual image and conceptual metaphor of a publishing robot to link R Markdown and Quarto, but also used a different colour, orange rather than blue, for the slide title to highlight it was just an FYI.\n\n\n\nTry it Yourself\nThe next hour was spent doing a hands-on walk-through of basic R Markdown functionality. Students were expected to follow along on their own computers while I live-coded on the big screen. However, in practice, I find students generally progress at different speeds.\n\n\n\nTo try and cater for different needs, the walk-through was a mixture of pre-planned exercises, extension links and improvised demo based on student requests. The pre-planned activities were ones that I explicitly wrote instructions for on the slides. The basic learning loop was:\n\nDo this\nRender\nObserve what happened\nDo something else\nRender\nObserve and compare\nRepeat from 1.\n\n\nFor each pre-planned exercise, I also provided an extension activity in the form of a call-out box at the bottom of each slide. The call-out box was coloured orange, contained a ‚Äúhow can we do ‚Ä¶?‚Äù style question and linked to a resource that answered the question. For example, the call-out in the slide below linked to section 5.4 Control the size of plots/images in the R Markdown Cookbook.\n\n\n\nSample activity slide showing the orange coloured extension call-out.\n\n\nAt the start of this activity, I explained the purpose of the extension call-outs, and reiterated that I would not be directly demonstrating any ‚Äúorange content‚Äù in the walk-through.\n\n\n\nI used a few different criteria and framings to choose and sequence the pre-planned and extension activities including:\n\nWhat kinds of documents are the students trying to write?\nWhat will be the most useful building block features for them to takeaway from the workshop?\nWhat features are least prone to bugs that might derail the momentum of the workshop?\nWhat are some logical extensions of the features shown in the workshop?\nShow and reinforce the ‚Äúrender > edit > render‚Äù loop within minimal waiting time.\nShow both source code and visual modes, but don‚Äôt switch back and forth too much to avoid losing students.\n\n\n\nWhat About‚Ä¶?\n\n\nOnce I had finished the walk-through, I gave students a mini-break / troubleshooting session. This was mostly just me floating around and checking in with each table. After helping a few students troubleshoot some minor issues2, I brought the class back together and introduce them to some more advanced R Markdown functionality. I tried to pick examples that highlighted different ways in which the authoring framework could be extended or customised:\n\ncross-references using {bookdown} as an example of the ‚Äúinstall package, get more markdown features‚Äù add-on ecosystem.\npretty tables using {gt} as an example of extra features that require explicitly coding in R.\nMicrosoft Word chapter from the R Markdown cookbook for more fine-tuned control of output formats.\n\nAgain, all of these slides used orange titles to signal that the content was related to, but outside the scope of the workshop.\n\n\n\nGetting Help\nFinally, I provided a quick recap of what we covered, and provided some tips for keeping up the momentum from the workshop:\n\nTry R Studio Visual mode before looking up markdown syntax. I included the R Studio Visual R Markdown documentation as an iframe.\nRead this wonderful guide on troubleshooting written by the LearnR team. Again, I directly included the LearnR Troubleshooting and asking for help webpage as an iframe, and specifically drew their attention to ‚ÄúSection 3: Asking for Help‚Äù.\nUnderstand the different kinds of R Markdown learning resources available. I used an adaptation of the Diataxis framework by Daniele Procida to curate a short list of useful links. I also tried limit myself to these resources when providing answers for the earlier extension call-outs."

    "text": "Workshop Reflections\n\n\n\nEmbedding content using iframes is easy!\n\n\n\niframes and hyperlinks\nThe best part of this workshop opportunity was getting to play with HTML slides. I think the workshop slides are a fun proof of concept for slides as a dynamic map and portal to existing (polished) learning resources, rather just delivering static ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù lesson content. iframes allow you to directly interact with the linked webpage from the slide without opening a new tab. This meant I could:\n\ndirectly incorporate high quality learning resources,\nfree up time for designing learning activities instead of writing content, and\nintroduce students to content in the exact format they would be referencing on their own after the workshop.\n\nThe downside of using iframes and hyperlinks is that it makes the slide deck rather ‚Äúfragile‚Äù since links could break or get moved. I tried to mitigate this risk somewhat by:\n\nmaking copies of any images that I used, and only using hyperlinks in the source attribution labels\nlimiting the number of source websites I linked to - i.e.¬†prioritising more ‚Äústable‚Äù or prominent sources like the R Markdown Cookbook, or the Knitr package website, and avoiding personal blogs or social media posts.\nwriting specific questions in the extension call-outs instead of a using generic ‚ÄúTry this!‚Äù call-out so that even if the link breaks, students can just Google the question.\n\nIf I could do it again, I‚Äôd probably include an appendix slide listing all the iframe sources so they could be easily searched for if the links break. In any case, updating iframe links is still easier than updating static slide content so I‚Äôm going to keep experimenting with them in my teaching.\n\n\nSlides.com and HTML slides\nI have a whole other blog post lined up about my many attempts to break up with Microsoft PowerPoint and go all in with plain-text. Unfortunately, I usually give up after two slides because markdown slides never look how I want them to, but I really do want to stop accumulating piles of final.pptx, final_final.pptx, and final_v4_after_edits.pptx files. Long story short, it‚Äôs happening, slowly but surely ‚Äî and with a combination of Quarto and reveal.js.\nFor this post, I only wanted to say that Slides.com is a great way to try out HTML slide functionality, without have to go down the very deep rabbit hole of learning reveal.js, figuring out how Quarto markdown interacts with reveal.js, and how to port all the different PowerPoint features I use into plain-text. I used an out-of-the-box template and managed to get pretty much everything I wanted to work. I did however have a minor hiccup during the workshop with the two different sharing modes. Initially, I linked students to the ‚ÄúPresent Live‚Äù URL. However, this mode only shows the slide you are currently presenting, which meant students couldn‚Äôt go ahead or backtrack in the Try-it-Yourself exercises. What I had actually wanted to do was link students to the slide deck. It was a relative easy fix, but did disrupt the flow of the workshop slightly."

    "section": "Inserting Emojis ‚å®Ô∏è",
    "text": "Inserting Emojis ‚å®Ô∏è\nFirst up, there are a few ways to include emojis in text that you are typing:\n\nShortcodes\nShortcodes are codes that allow you to ‚Äútype‚Äù emojis using a short version of the emoji name. For example, :smiley: for üòÉ.2\nShortcodes are supported in most extended markdown formats and markdown editors:\n\nAvailable with auto-complete prompts in applications like Slack, RStudio Visual Mode and Notion.\nSome platforms like Slack even support custom shortcode aliases and additional emojis.\nThe {emo} R package provides support for adding emojis as in-line code chunks to Rmarkdown via shortcode. E.g. üòÑ renders to üòÑ.3\n\nPRO:\n\nQuick once you know the shortcodes.\n\nCON:\n\nYou need to know and remember the shortcodes, or at least the start of the shortcode for applications that support auto-complete.\nShortcodes vary from application to application. This means shortcodes in one flavour of markdown might not render the same way or at all in a different flavour of markdown.4\n\nSome cheatsheets for finding the application-specific shortcode for an emoji:\n\nHolopod‚Äôs Slack Emoji Cheatsheet\nWebFX‚Äôs Emoji Cheatsheet\nEmojibase‚Äôs Shortcodes table\n\n\n\nEmoji Pickers\nEmoji pickers are input tools that allow you to browse and select emojis. They can include inline pop-up keyboards and search helpers, or a separate Character/Symbol dialog windows.\nYour operating system will likely provide a default emoji picker tool (though they are all annoyingly given different names‚Ä¶):\n\non macOS: use the shortcut CTRL + ATL + SPACE to bring up the Character Viewer\non iOS/iPadOS: select the emoji keyboard using Emoji Button or Globe from any text input.\non Windows: use the shortcut WINDOWS-KEY + . to bring up the Emoji Panel.\n\nEmojipedia‚Äôs Can I Emoji? page links to guides for emoji usage on other common devices.\nSome applications also provide emoji pickers, which you can usually access via the SPECIAL CHARACTER item in the INSERT menu, and/or the associated keyboard shortcut.\n\nin Rstudio Visual Mode:\n\nuse the catch-all shortcut ‚åò /emoji to bring up the emoji picker.\nAlternatively, use the menu sequence Insert -> Special Characters -> Emoji‚Ä¶ to bring up an emoji picker.\n\n\nPRO:\n\nUse search terms to find emojis. Great for when you don‚Äôt know the exact emoji you want to use, or are looking to find a suitable emoji. If you want more search results, try Emojipedia‚Äôs search5.\n\nCON:\n\nSlower than shortcodes when inserting frequently used emojis.\nThe picker will usually close after you insert one emoji, so you need to open the picker repeatedly if you are inserting multiple emojis.\n\n\n\nCopy-Paste\nWhen all else fails you can try to copy-paste the emoji from somewhere like Emojipedia. Basically any application that supports UTF-8 encoding should display emoji characters. I don‚Äôt really consider this a viable method though because it is too slow and cumbersome to use in day-to-day workflows.\n\n\nComparing Input Methods\nExactly which methods are available depends on what application or file format you are working with. Keep in mind that support for displaying or rendering emojis doesn‚Äôt automatically mean it will be easy to insert emojis.\nMy general strategy for figuring out how to add emojis into a particular workflow is to Google ‚Äúemoji‚Äù + whichever program/markup/environment I‚Äôm working in. If you‚Äôre using a tool that supports markdown, try searching the Tools directory of The Markdown Guide.\nPersonally, I tend to use shortcodes for frequently used and more ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù emojis, but switch to an emoji picker if I want to browse, or to insert a specific version of an emoji (e.g.¬†picking a different skin-tone)."

    "text": "Epilogue: More Adventures in Quarto and Website Debugging\n\nAs I went to share this post on twitter, I found the card was being generated but the image I wanted use didn‚Äôt show up‚Ä¶ leading me to another convoluted troubleshooting session. I tried:\n\nchanging the featured image to a different one\nchanging the name of the featured image file\ndoing all sorts of card debugging fixes suggested by the Internet.\n\nBut it turned out it wasn‚Äôt a metadata issue. Quarto hadn‚Äôt copied the image file over into my output directory (_site/ by default), so the image wasn‚Äôt being hosted on website to be shown in a twitter card. I think the underlying issue was that I had left the draft: true option on, which apparently means images don‚Äôt get copied over, not just that the post wont be shown in listings.\nIn any case, removing that option fixed the issue, and thus continues the saga of learning website design through the convenient but somewhat opaque framework of Quarto website projects."
