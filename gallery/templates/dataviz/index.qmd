## Notes on Sketchnote Accessibility

At the moment, all alt-text is provided below the image itself, as I'm not sure what the best way to embed alt-text into SVG objects is. My approach will likely evolve as I learn more html/css/svg concepts.

  - `alt-text` for the sketchnote is defined in `params: main_alt_text:` and provides a description of key illustration elements.
  - `aria-label` is used for interactive elements. Any link embedded in the image is also provided underneath the image
