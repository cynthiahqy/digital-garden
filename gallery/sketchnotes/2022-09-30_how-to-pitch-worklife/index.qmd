As .png:
![](images/how-to-pitch_worklife-adam-grant.png)

As `<img>` 9from`![]()`) inside `column-page`:

- simple to include but anchors (hyperlinks) don't work
- converts to `<img class="img-fluid">`

:::{.column-page}
![](images/how-to-pitch.svg)
:::

As object inside `.column-page` div:

- hyperlink works but size doesn't adjust correctly
- fixed it by adding `width=100%` attribute to match the `.img-fluid` class defined in [quarto-cli/~/_bootstrap-rules.scss](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/6c44f1181301d1241cd48e2bb7a5253d370cfe15/src/resources/formats/html/bootstrap/_bootstrap-rules.scss#L473-L481)

:::{.column-page style="border: solid black"}
  <object type="image/svg+xml" data="images/how-to-pitch.svg" width=80% style= "border: solid blue">

  </object>  
  
  <object type="image/svg+xml" data="images/how-to-pitch.svg" class="img-fluid">
