üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I am an interdisciplinary researcher with pronouns she/her. I work at the intersection of social science, computational statistics and human-centered computing. My many hats include economist, data scientist, research software engineer, and teacher. Currently, my main hat is Research Fellow in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University, working on principles and methods for data preparation and preprocessing, under the supervision of [Rob J Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com). My PhD thesis **_Unified Principles and Tools for Complex Datasets and Data-Driven Workflows_** is currently under examination and was co-supervised by Rob, [Simon Angus](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/simon-angus), and [Sarah Goodwin](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/sarah-goodwin).

Check out my [now page](now.qmd) for semi-frequent updates on what I'm working on and thinking about. My favourite side hats at the moment are co-host of the [Random Sample](https://www.therandomsample.com.au/) podcast, and [Quarto](https://quarto.org) evangelist and tinkerer.


<!-- ü§πüèªThis blog is a seed nursery for holding ideas, thoughts and projects I'm juggling while I build my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). Expect anything from machine learning, data wrangling, reproducible workflows, teaching pedagogy to half-formed opinions on social issues, personal data-viz, and winding journeys through my special interests of the moment. -->
